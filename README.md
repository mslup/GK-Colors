# Image Processing App for Computer Graphics Course

## Overview

This project, developed for the Computer Graphics course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science at WUT, is an image processing application. The app calculates color histograms of an imported image and provides a user-friendly interface to apply kernel filters within a brush- or a polygon-selected region.

## Features

- **Histogram Calculation:** The app generates histograms for the red, green, and blue color channels of the imported image, providing insights into the color distribution.
  
- **Region Filtering:** Users can interactively select regions within the image using brushes or polygons. Kernel filters can then be applied specifically to these regions, allowing for localized image enhancements.

- **Kernel Filters:** The app supports a variety of kernel filters, enabling users to apply convolution operations for tasks such as blurring, sharpening, edge detection, and more.
